# Datacamp participants info scraping

Every time I start a new course, I see those participants numbers on top of the page.  
But which are the popular courses? How many additional participants every month?

So this is a small project to scrape every month the participants number on all Datacamp courses, so I can find out which courses I'm missing out on...
